## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


**Hello,

I am currently a senior at Hunter College studying Computer Science and Economics. 

Prior to majoring in computer science I was a pre med student. Planning to major in biochemistry, and completing research in microbiology, I had hopes of being a future doctor. However, I made the switch to computer science after seeing the impact technology has made in virtually every industry. I realized that there was more than just one way to help people and that I could make just as much of a difference studying computer science. 

After studying computer science for four years I have created several projects (linked below) that have enhanced my coding skills. However, after working on so many projects I fostered a passion for project and product management. I took on project and product management duties in these projects and internships because of my newfound appreciation for working with both consumers and developers and at the intersection of tech and business to create a product that served purpose and had meaning. 

Iâ€™ve always had an appreciation for the arts and creatives but never saw myself as the actual artist. Instead I want to use my more technical abilities and mindset to help leverage creatives through tech and operations. Join me on this journey as I aim to bridge the gap between my passions for the arts, business, and tech.
